This project demonstrates adding end-to-end test coverage to a full web app using a variety of tools:

* [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/)
* [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
* [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)
* [remap-istanbul](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul)
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Checkout previous commits to replay the evolution from ground zero (simple node.js module with manual testing and instrumentation) to a full app with end-to-end coverage reporting.
